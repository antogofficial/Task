        <p> I love I.T because I see it as working toward the future which would be technology based. In this case, I would be able to assist many people that are not familiar with I.T. 
            Not only is it one of my passions but it also pays well and I'd have security knowledge in the event of a cyber attack. </p> <!-- (W3schools.com, 2024) -->
